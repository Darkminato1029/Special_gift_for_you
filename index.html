   <h4 style="text-align:center"><u>how cute be both are </u>(‚Å†„Éª‚Å†‚àÄ‚Å†„Éª‚Å†)</h4>
   
  
    <p><i>You came as a ray of light,<br>
Made my life cheerful and bright,<br>
Showering your affection over me<br>
So that my face was full of glee.<br>
Taking away my complete loneliness<br>
And giving me back all the happiness<br>
With a Midas touch of your care<br>
To keep me away from despair.<br>
I‚Äôll never leave you midway,<br>
And tales of our bond people will say.</i></p>

<p><i>A friend like you is hard to find,<br>
You act so silly<br>
You are one of a kind,<br>
A little dumb but a little sweet<br>
This is how I wanted to greet<br>
To a super yet funny friend I know<br>
I may never show<br>
But, still, I love you to the core<br>
Cheers to friendship!

<p><i>You keep all my secrets<br>
And I can trust you well<br>
If we did something unusual<br>
Then both will go to hell<br>
Best friends are friends for life<br>
Without you, I won‚Äôt survive<br>
You are so special to me<br>
It is everywhere you, I can see<br>
Enough I think, for your glee!</i></p>

<p><i>
    If you‚Äôre feeling down, turn your frown upside down.<br>
Put a smile on your face; take the world in your embrace.<br>
Ask for a little help from the man up above.<br>
And remember you have your best friend‚Äôs love.

<p><i>
    The feeling of friendship from the start<br>
Is that special feeling in your heart<br>
A feeling from deep down inside<br>
A feeling that no one should hide<br>
A friend is there through good and bad<br>
They make you happy when you‚Äôre sad<br>
they brighten up your darkest day<br>
Just by the simple thing‚Äôs they say<br>
Now friendship can‚Äôt be bought or sold<br>
It may get tarnished and may get old<br>
You can overcome your greatest fear<br>
Just look around, and it is there<br>
Now friendship‚Äôs one and only cost<br>
Is to make sure that it‚Äôs never lost(‚Å†„ÜÅ‚Å†œâ‚Å†„ÜÅ‚Å†)

<p><i>
    To see that face you‚Äôve missed so much,<br>
To feel that warmth inside.<br>
To see how much you mean to them,<br>
Reflected in their eyes.<br>

To feel that sense of comfort.<br>
That you felt in times gone by.<br>
To hug someone with all your might,<br>
To laugh until you cry.<br>

To escape to all those memories,<br>
Those moments that you shared.<br>
To feel each strong emotion,<br>
As if you were right there.
